# Backend Instructions for Kids Memory Tournament with QR Code System

## Overview
The Memory Match game has been updated for kids with QR code access, mobile-optimized full-screen gameplay, and tournament management. No registration or money involved - purely for fun with symbolic rewards.

## QR Code Tournament Features
- Full-screen mobile gameplay when accessed via QR codes
- No navigation bars or headers (immersive gaming for kids)
- Tournament creation and QR code generation from frontend
- Anonymous player submission for kids tournaments
- Mobile-responsive design optimized for phones and tablets

## Required Backend Changes

### 1. Update Memory Game Session Model
The memory game sessions now use 12 pairs (24 cards) and include rules display:

```python
# Expected data format from frontend:
{
    "difficulty": "intermediate",  # Always intermediate for 6x4 grid (12 pairs)
    "time_seconds": 120,  # Longer time for more cards
    "moves_count": 24,    # More moves expected for 12 pairs
    "completed": True,
    "tournament": "kids-tournament",  # Generic tournament ID or specific tournament slug
    "player_name": "Player 1234",  # Anonymous player with timestamp
    "room_number": "Kids Tournament"  # Generic room identifier
}
```

### Game Rules System:
- Rules display automatically when tournament starts via QR code
- Rules button available during gameplay for reference
- Mobile-optimized rules modal for kids
- Updated for 12 pairs (24 cards) gameplay

### 2. Modify Tournament Validation
Remove any validation that requires:
- Real room number verification
- Guest registration checks  
- Payment processing
- Personal information validation

### 3. Anonymous Player Handling & Score Calculation
Update the memory session creation to handle 12-pair games:

```python
# In your memory session view/serializer:
def create_memory_session(self, validated_data):
    # Accept anonymous player names
    if validated_data.get('player_name', '').startswith('Player '):
        # This is an anonymous kids tournament entry
        validated_data['is_anonymous'] = True
    
    # Don't validate room numbers for "Kids Tournament"
    if validated_data.get('room_number') == "Kids Tournament":
        validated_data['room_validation_required'] = False
    
    return super().create(validated_data)

# Updated score calculation for 12 pairs:
def calculate_score(difficulty, time_seconds, moves_count):
    multipliers = {'easy': 1.0, 'intermediate': 1.5, 'hard': 2.0}
    optimal_moves = {'easy': 16, 'intermediate': 24, 'hard': 32}  # 12 pairs = 24 optimal moves
    
    base_score = multipliers[difficulty] * 1000
    time_penalty = time_seconds * 2
    moves_penalty = max(0, moves_count - optimal_moves[difficulty]) * 5
    
    return max(0, int(base_score - time_penalty - moves_penalty))
```

### 4. Tournament Leaderboard Adjustments
For kids tournaments, consider:
- Showing only first names or anonymous player numbers
- Adding fun emoji badges instead of monetary rewards
- Limiting leaderboard to recent games (e.g., last 24 hours)

### 5. API Endpoint Updates
Ensure these endpoints handle anonymous submissions:
- `POST /api/entertainment/memory-sessions/` (public API)
- `GET /api/entertainment/tournaments/{id}/leaderboard/` 

### 6. Tournament Management API Endpoints
Frontend now includes tournament creation and management. **URGENT: These endpoints are needed to fix the 500 errors:**

```python
# REQUIRED API endpoints (currently causing 500 errors):
POST /api/entertainment/tournaments/          # Create new tournament
GET  /api/entertainment/tournaments/          # List all tournaments  
GET  /api/entertainment/tournaments/{id}/     # Get tournament details
PATCH /api/entertainment/tournaments/{id}/    # Update tournament
GET  /api/entertainment/tournaments/{id}/leaderboard/  # Tournament leaderboard

# Tournament Model Example:
class KidsTournament(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    start_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    end_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Kids Tournament: {self.name}"

# Tournament ViewSet Example:
class TournamentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = KidsTournament.objects.all()
    serializer_class = TournamentSerializer
    
    @action(detail=True, methods=['get'])
    def leaderboard(self, request, pk=None):
        tournament = self.get_object()
        # Get memory sessions for this tournament
        sessions = MemorySession.objects.filter(
            tournament=pk
        ).order_by('-score')[:10]
        return Response(sessions)
```

### ðŸš¨ Current Status:
- Frontend is ready with mock data fallbacks
- Tournament dashboard shows development mode warning
- QR code generation works but needs backend for persistence
- All tournament API calls gracefully handle 404/500 errors

### 7. Reward System
Since this is for symbolic rewards only, you could add:
- Fun badges/achievements 
- Completion certificates
- Encouraging messages
- No monetary values or real prizes

### 8. Data Privacy Considerations
Since this involves kids:
- Don't store any real personal information
- Use anonymous player identifiers
- Consider auto-cleanup of old game sessions
- Ensure COPPA compliance if applicable

## QR Code Integration Details

### QR Code URLs Generated:
- **Play Tournament:** `/tournament/{tournament_id}` (full-screen mobile game)
- **View Champions:** `/tournament/{tournament_id}/leaderboard` (mobile-friendly leaderboard)

### QR Code Generation:
- Uses qr-server.com API (no npm package dependency required)
- 300x300 pixel QR codes optimized for mobile scanning
- Downloadable as PNG files for printing/sharing
- Works without external dependencies

### Mobile-First Design Considerations:
- QR codes take users to full-screen game (no navigation)
- Game layout optimized for 6x4 grid (12 pairs, 24 cards)
- Touch-friendly card sizes: `minmax(55px, 1fr)` on mobile
- Simplified UI with large, easy-to-read elements
- Automatic rules display when starting tournament via QR
- Rules access button always available during gameplay

## Frontend Integration Points
The frontend now sends:
- Anonymous player names (Player + timestamp)
- Generic room number "Kids Tournament"  
- No personal information collection
- Direct game start without registration form
- Tournament creation data from frontend dashboard
- QR code generation requests

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement tournament API endpoints to fix 500 errors
- [ ] Tournament CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Anonymous player sessions created successfully
- [ ] No validation errors for "Kids Tournament" room numbers
- [ ] Leaderboard displays anonymous players appropriately
- [ ] Public API accepts tournament submissions without authentication
- [ ] QR code tournament flow works on mobile devices
- [ ] Full-screen game mode works when accessed via QR codes
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout on phones and tablets
- [ ] No personal data required or stored
- [ ] Tournament creation from frontend dashboard

## Error Resolution
**Current 500 Error Fix:**
1. Implement tournament model and viewset in Django
2. Add tournament URLs to urlpatterns
3. Create tournament serializers
4. Test tournament endpoints with Postman/curl
5. Frontend will automatically switch from mock data to real API

## Migration Notes
If you have existing tournament data:
- Consider flagging existing sessions as "adult tournaments" 
- Create separate leaderboards for kids vs adult tournaments
- Update any existing validation rules
