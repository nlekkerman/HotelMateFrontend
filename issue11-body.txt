**Goal:** Make the confirmation flow clear for staff users.

**Tasks:**
- After successful confirmation:
  - Visually mark booking as confirmed (status pill, color change)
  - Show toast/snackbar with clear message
- Optional:
  - Add a subtle label in the detail view: "Confirmation email sent to <guest_email>"
  - Reserve UI area for future "Resend confirmation" action

**Success Message Examples:**
- "Booking confirmed! Confirmation email has been sent to guest@example.com"
- "Booking #12345 confirmed successfully"

**Visual Indicators:**
- Green badge for confirmed status
- Success icon next to status
- Disabled confirm button with checkmark after confirmation

**Deliverable:** Clean staff UX around confirming bookings and understanding the outcome
