## Security & Permissions

All endpoints follow the established security patterns:

### Public Endpoints
- ✅ AllowAny permission for public hotel settings

### Staff Endpoints
- ✅ IsAuthenticated - User must be logged in
- ✅ IsStaffMember - User must have staff_profile
- ✅ IsSameHotel - Staff must belong to the hotel in URL
- ✅ Hotel slug validation on every request
- ✅ Staff ownership verification

### Optional Restrictions (Ready to Enable)
- Role-based access control for settings updates
- Role-based access control for booking confirmations
- Both are commented out in code and can be enabled by uncommenting

---

## Email Configuration

The email system uses Django's built-in email framework:

### Requirements
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` setting must be configured
- Email backend must be configured (SMTP, SendGrid, etc.)
- Guest email addresses must be valid

### Behavior
- ✅ Sends confirmation email on booking confirmation
- ✅ Includes all booking details
- ✅ Failures logged but don't prevent confirmation
- ✅ Wrapped in try/except for resilience

---

## Frontend Integration

A comprehensive frontend API guide has been created:
- **Location:** `docs/PHASE1_FRONTEND_API_GUIDE.md`
- **Contents:**
  - Complete API documentation
  - Request/response examples
  - JavaScript usage examples
  - Error handling guide
  - Implementation checklist
  - Troubleshooting guide

## Testing Strategy (To Be Implemented)

### Test Coverage Needed

#### Hotel Settings Tests
1. Public endpoint returns data for valid hotel
2. Public endpoint creates default settings if missing
3. Public endpoint returns 404 for invalid hotel
4. Staff can update their own hotel settings
5. Staff cannot update other hotel settings (403)
6. Non-staff users cannot update settings (403)
7. Unauthenticated users cannot update settings (401)

#### Bookings Tests
1. Staff can list their hotel's bookings
2. Staff cannot list other hotel's bookings (403)
3. Booking filters work correctly (status, dates)
4. Staff can confirm bookings
5. Confirmation email is triggered
6. Cannot confirm cancelled bookings
7. Already confirmed bookings handled gracefully

---

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements
1. Add `confirmed_by` and `confirmed_at` fields to RoomBooking model
2. Implement pagination for bookings list
3. Add booking search by guest name/email
4. Add bulk booking operations
5. Implement Stripe webhook for automatic confirmation
6. Add booking export functionality
7. Add advanced reporting and analytics
8. Enable role-based restrictions for sensitive operations

### Code Comments
- Role-based restrictions are commented out in both views
- Easy to enable by uncommenting specific code blocks
- See inline comments in:
  - `hotel/views.py` - HotelPublicSettingsStaffView
  - `hotel/views.py` - StaffBookingConfirmView
