**Goal:** Allow staff to open a single booking and confirm it.

**Tasks:**
- From the bookings list:
  - Clicking a row opens a detail panel/page:
    - Show all booking info: guest details, room, dates, amounts, notes, payment info if available
- If booking is in a pending/confirmable state:
  - Show **"Confirm booking"** button
  - On click:
    - Call `POST /api/staff/hotels/<hotel_slug>/bookings/<booking_id>/confirm/`
    - Show loading state
    - On success:
      - Update booking status in the list + detail view
      - Show success toast: e.g. "Booking confirmed. Confirmation email has been sent to the guest."
- Handle server errors gracefully (e.g. already confirmed, cancelled)

**Deliverable:** Booking detail + confirm UX wired to backend
