**Goal:** Provide simple UI to enter/exit editor mode for staff.

**Tasks:**
- When `canEdit && viewMode === "guest"`:
  - Show a button on the page (e.g. top-right):
    - Label: **"Customize public page"**
    - On click → `setViewMode("editor")`
- When `canEdit && viewMode === "editor"`:
  - Show an editor bar at top or bottom:
    - Text like: `"You are editing this public page"`
    - Button: **"View as guest"** → sets `viewMode = "guest"`

**NEW REQUIREMENT - Superuser Toggle:**
For superuser/admin staff viewing ANY hotel page:
- Show a prominent toggle (e.g., top-right corner with icon)
- Toggle should be visible on BOTH public hotel page and staff dashboard
- Clearly indicate current mode (Guest View / Staff View)
- Allow switching between views regardless of which hotel they're viewing
- Visual indicator: badge, icon, or colored bar showing active mode
- This is SEPARATE from the editor mode toggle (which is for editing settings)

**Deliverable:** Buttons/bar visually integrated with existing design

**Related Files:**
- `src/pages/HotelPortalPage.jsx`
- `src/components/layout/` (for shared toggle component if needed)

**Dependencies:** Issue #2, Issue #3

**UI Components:** React Bootstrap Button, ButtonGroup, Badge
